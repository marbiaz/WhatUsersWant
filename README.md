WhatUsersWant
=============

What Users Want (WUW) implements a decentralized P2P framework to measure and improve the satisfaction
of users based on their personal preferences.

WUW computes at each peer the attitude the local user towards her neighbors 
and influences the local neighborhoods accordingly, to improve user satisfaction.

The satisfaction of each user is dynamically evaluated at each peer and it depends on 
to what extent the system takes into account her preferences.

The current prototype runs on top of BitTorrent.
